# Hangman-A-Simple-AngularJS-Game

Hangman is a simple game created using AngularJS. The goal of this game is to guess a word within 6 chances one letter at a time. Every wrong guess decreases the counter by 1 while every correct guess reveals the position of that letter in the word (even if it appears multiple times). Submitting the same letter again will not affect the game.
Some key points:
- Developed in AngularJS 1.x (using CDN)
- Simple layout with some basic styling
- Words are currently hard feeded and selected at random
- Words are only 3-letter long for the sake of demo
- The correct word is printed in console
